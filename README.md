***CS 580:*** High Performance Computing

**Project 1:** K nearest neighbors using Kd Tree and threads

K-NN in a parallelized manner using threads in C++ and . Arguments include 1, number of cores, 2, training data (for building the Kd tree)source, 3, query data (for find k nearest point) source, and a third argument that currently serves no purpose, but was used as a debug argument and needs to be altered.

**Project 2:** Sampling points uniformly on unit n-dimensional sphere

Need to commit code

**Project 3:** CNN on MNIST data using CUDA and thrust

Test code on thrust, still need to add actual code.
